Currently work in progress.

Removals:

0.3.0 (2015-11-20)

This release implements the oplog feature. It allows to let the plugin listen to MongoDB's oplog and apply all changes
ingame, which are made in database. See README.md for further information.

This feature is highly experimental and may contains bugs. To improve and stabilize this feature I need feedback. It is
also important to report error messages or any inconvenient behaviour on the GitHub issue tracker:
https://github.com/maxikg/mongowg/issues

Removals:
-

Additions:
 * Supports listeners on region save or deletion
 * OpLog parser and its bridge to WorldGuard

Changes:
 * Outsource storage into it's own class (RegionStorageAdapter)

0.2.0 (2015-11-18)

This release mainly migrates to MongoDB's codecs. It serializes and deserializes various data at a much lower level
than the previous used mix of BsonDocument's and Document's.

Removals:
 * Removed DataUtils and its unit test during migration to MongoDB's codecs.

Additions:
 * Added BlockVector2DCodec (Codec for reading/writing com.sk89q.worldedit.BlockVector2D) and its unit test
 * Added BlockVectorCodec (Codec for reading/writing com.sk89q.worldedit.BlockVector) and its unit test
 * Added DefaultDomainCodec (Codec for reading/writing com.sk89q.worldguard.domains.DefaultDomain) and its unit test
 * Added ProcessingProtectedRegionCodec (Codec for reading/writing de.maxikg.mongowg.model.ProcessingProtectedRegion)
   and its unit test

Changes:
 * Improved initial connection error handling
 * Changed manner of how connections are built
